# EIS_From_WF_to_ZView      Windows version.
Language c++
IDE: QT Creator 4.10

This is my first try in github. This little program was made to transform format files data from EIS experiences from DAD2+WaveForm3.12 to be processed in Zview.

This software is setted to create a new file with the same name as the Original File but added ".zview" before the extention.
If I transform the file "EIS_1.txt", the output will be "EIS_1.zview.txt".

The menu and instructions are in Spanish. If you want an english version, please ask. I was just lazy.


MALFUNCTION??
-Due to the function of creating a new file sometimes the antivirus blocks it. Make sure to use the exception list or disable your Antivirus.

-Even you can introduce a whole path, the fastest way is to copy anything you want to transform in the folder "EIS DATASET".

-Be careful to enter the wrong file name. If you do, it won't work and it will just shut itself down.
#####It might be nice to add a flag when the software can't find the file.


POSSIBLE and simple IMPROVEMENTS:

#### It might be nice to add a flag when the software can't find the file.

#### Add an option to transform all files in a folder creating a new folder (and listing the ones that could not be transformed).

#### A graphical interface?

#### stickers and bluetooht connection.         Just kidding.
